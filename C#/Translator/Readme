Task: I need code that will go to Google with the text that is in Japanese, fetch the text back for a word, 
store it in a list and then go to Google again to get the English for the next Japanese word. 
Repeating this until all words have been translated. Note it must be one by one translated at a time.

After contact with employer, i made a proposal to use Microsoft translating api, and in my project used DarrenLee.dll
