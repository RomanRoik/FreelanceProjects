Task: Hi there, I am looking for a C# module that will take as input an English sentence and identify if it is gramatically correct.

The output can be like a JSON structure that contains the original sentence, flag if grammatically correct/ incorrect and possibly a list of incorrect grammatical areas.

I need a console application and the C# code.

Done this project with a help of GingerApi and web requests
